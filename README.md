# hello-world

I'm Milian, a twenty-something computer programming major at some community college.
I like video games, and furries, and dark beers...
I'm a big procrastinator and shit at checking my e-mail.
I'm way gay. Just ask my two datefriends.

My aspirations in computer programming are to one day be a game developer or to work for a software company.

Let's eat butt or whatever.
